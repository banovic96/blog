          <p>    NAME <br>
       chown - change file owner and group

<p>SYNOPSIS <br>
       chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE... <br>
       chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

<p>DESCRIPTION
     <p>  This  manual  page documents the GNU version <br>
        of chown.  chown
       changes the user and/or group ownership of each  given  file.
       If  only  an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given,
       that user is made the owner  of  each  given  file,  and  the
       files'  group  is not changed.  If the owner is followed by a
       colon and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no  spaces
       between  them, the group ownership of the files is changed as
       well.  If a colon but no group name follows  the  user  name,
       that user is made the owner of the files and the group of the
       files is changed to that user's login group.   If  the  colon
       and group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group
       of the files is changed; in this  case,  chown  performs  the
       same  function as chgrp.  If only a colon is given, or if the
       entire operand is empty, neither the owner nor the  group  is
       changed.

<p>OPTIONS <br>
       Change  the  owner  and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or
       GROUP.  With --reference, change the owner and group of  each
       FILE to those of RFILE.

     <p>  -c, --changes <br>
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

     <p>  -f, --silent, --quiet <br>
              suppress most error messages

     <p>  -v, --verbose <br>
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

    <p>   --dereference <br>
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the
              default), rather than the symbolic link itself

     <p>  -h, --no-dereference <br>
              affect symbolic links instead of any  referenced  file
              (useful  only on systems that can change the ownership
              of a symlink)

      <p> --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP <br>
              change the owner and/or group of each file only if its
              current owner and/or group match those specified here.
              Either may be omitted, in which case a  match  is  not
              required for the omitted attribute

    <p>   --no-preserve-root <br>
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

  <p>     --preserve-root <br>
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

    <p>   --reference=RFILE <br>
              use  RFILE's  owner  and  group rather than specifying
              OWNER:GROUP values

  <p>     -R, --recursive <br>
              operate on files and directories recursively

   <p>    The following options modify how  a  hierarchy  is  traversed
       when  the  -R  option is also specified.  If more than one is
       specified, only the final one takes effect.

   <p>    -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a di‐
              rectory, traverse it

     <p>  -L     traverse  every  symbolic  link to a directory encoun‐
              tered

     <p>  -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

      <p> --help display this help and exit

      <p> --version <br>
              output version information and exit

    <p>   Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged  if  miss‐
       ing, but changed to login group if implied by a ':' following
       a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well  as
       symbolic.

<p>EXAMPLES <br>
      <p> chown root /u <br>
              Change the owner of /u to "root".

     <p>  chown root:staff /u <br>
              Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".

    <p>   chown -hR root /u <br>
              Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".
