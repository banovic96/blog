<p>NAME <br>
       plocate - find files by name, quickly

<p>SYNOPSIS <br>
       plocate [OPTION]...  PATTERN...

<p>DESCRIPTION <br>
       plocate finds all files on the system matching the given pat‐
       tern (or all of the patterns if multiple are given). It  does
       this  by  means of an index made by updatedb(8) or (less com‐
       monly) converted from another index by plocate-build(8).

      <p> plocate is largely argument-compatible with  mlocate(1),  but
       is  significantly  faster.  In particular, it rarely needs to
       scan through its entire database, unless the pattern is  very
       short  (less  than  three  bytes) or you want to search for a
       regular expression. It does not try to maintain compatibility
       with BSD locate, or non-UTF-8 filenames and locales. Most I/O
       is done asynchronously, but the results are  synchronized  so
       that output comes in the same order every time.

      <p> When  multiple  patterns  are  given, plocate will search for
       files that match all of them. This is the main  incompatibil‐
       ity  with mlocate(1), which searches for files that match one
       or more patterns, unless the -A option is given.

     <p>  By default, patterns are taken to  be  substrings  to  search
       for.   If at least one non-escaped globbing metacharacter (*,
       ? or []) is given, that pattern is instead taken to be a glob
       pattern  (which  means  it  needs to start and end in * for a
       substring match). If --regexp is given, patterns are  instead
       taken  to  be (non-anchored) POSIX basic regular expressions,
       and if --regex is given, patterns are taken to be  POSIX  ex‐
       tended  regular  expressions.  All of this matches mlocate(1)
       behavior.

     <p>  Like mlocate(1), plocate shows all files visible to the call‐
       ing user (by virtue of having read and execute permissions on
       all parent directories), and none that are not, by  means  of
       running with the setgid bit set to access the index (which is
       built as root), but by  testing  visibility  as  the  calling
       user.

<p>OPTIONS
      <p> -A, --all <br>
              Ignored for compatibility with mlocate(1).

     <p>  -b, --basename <br>
              Match  only  against the file name portion of the path
              name, ie., the directory names will be  excluded  from
              the  match (but still printed). This does not speed up
              the search, but can suppress uninteresting matches.

     <p>  -c, --count <br>
              Do not print each  match.  Instead,  count  them,  and
              print out a total number at the end.

      <p> -d, --database DBPATH <br>
              Find   matches  in  the  given  database,  instead  of
              /var/lib/plocate/plocate.db.   This  argument  can  be
              given  multiple  times,  to search multiple databases.
              It is also possible to give multiple databases in  one
              argument, separated by :.  (Any character, including :
              and \, can be escaped by prepending a \.)

     <p>  -e, --existing <br>
              Print only entries that refer to files existing at the
              time  locate is run. Note that unlike mlocate(1), sym‐
              links are not followed by default (and  indeed,  there
              is no option to change this).

     <p>  -i, --ignore-case <br>
              Do  a  case-insensitive  match as given by the current
              locale  (default   is   case-sensitive,   byte-by-byte
              match).  Note  that  plocate does not support the full
              range of Unicode case folding  rules;  in  particular,
              searching  for  ß will not give you matches on ss even
              in a German locale. Also note that this option will be
              somewhat  slower than a case-sensitive match, since it
              needs to generate more candidates  for  searching  the
              index.

      <p> -p, --ignore-spaces <br>
              Ignore punctuation and spaces when matching patterns.

      <p> -l, --limit LIMIT
              Stop searching after LIMIT matches have been found. If
              --count is given, the number printed out  will  be  at
              most LIMIT.

     <p>  -N, --literal <br>
              Print  entry  names without quoting. Normally, plocate
              will escape special characters in filenames,  so  that
              they are safe for consumption by typical shells (simi‐
              lar to the GNU coreutils  shell-escape-always  quoting
              style),  unless  printing  to a pipe, but this options
              will turn off such quoting.

     <p>  -0, --null <br>
              Instead of writing a newline after every match,  write
              a NUL (ASCII 0). This is useful for creating unambigu‐
              ous output when it is to be processed by  other  tools
              (like  xargs(1)),  as filenames are allowed to contain
              embedded newlines.

      <p> -r, --regexp <br>
              Patterns are taken to be POSIX basic  regular  expres‐
              sions.   See  regex(7) for more information. Note that
              this forces a linear scan through the entire database,
              which is slow.

     <p>  --regex <br>
              Like  --regexp,  but  patterns are instead taken to be
              POSIX extended regular expressions.

     <p>  -w, --wholename <br>
              Match against the entire path name. This  is  the  de‐
              fault,  so  unless  -b  is given first (see above), it
              will not do anything. This option thus exists only  as
              compatibility with mlocate(1).

     <p>  --help Print out usage information, then exit successfully.

     <p>  --version <br>
              Print out version information, then exit successfully.

<p>ENVIRONMENT 
     <p>  LOCATE_PATH
              If  given, appended after the list of --database paths
              (whether an explicit is given or the default is used).
              Colon-delimiting  and  character  escaping follows the
              same rules as for --database.
