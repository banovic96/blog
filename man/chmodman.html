<p> NAME <br>
       chmod - change file mode bits

S<p> SYNOPSIS <br>
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE... <br>
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE... <br>
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE... <br>

       <p> DESCRIPTION <br>
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given  file  according  to <br>
       mode,  which  can  be  either  a  symbolic  representation of
       changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pat‐
       tern for the new mode bits.

       <p>  The      format      of      a      symbolic      mode     is
       [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero  or
       more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the
       set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated  by
       commas.

       <p>   A  combination  of the letters ugoa controls which users' ac‐
       cess to the file will be changed: the user who owns  it  (u),
       other  users  in the file's group (g), other users not in the
       file's group (o), or all users (a).  If  none  of  these  are
       given,  the effect is as if (a) were given, but bits that are
       set in the umask are not affected.

       <p>     The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added
       to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them to
       be removed; and = causes them to be added and  causes  unmen‐
       tioned  bits  to  be removed except that a directory's unmen‐
       tioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

       <p>     The letters rwxXst select file mode  bits  for  the  affected
       users:  read  (r), write (w), execute (or search for directo‐
       ries) (x), execute/search only if the file is a directory  or
       already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or
       group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky
       bit  (t).   Instead  of one or more of these letters, you can
       specify exactly one  of  the  letters  ugo:  the  permissions
       granted  to  the  user who owns the file (u), the permissions
       granted to other users who are members of  the  file's  group
       (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in neither
       of the two preceding categories (o).

       <p>   A numeric mode is from one to four octal  digits  (0-7),  de‐
       rived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted
       digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit  se‐
       lects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted
       deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit  selects
       permissions  for  the user who owns the file: read (4), write
       (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other
       users  in  the  file's  group,  with the same values; and the
       fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same
       values.

       <p>     chmod  never  changes  the permissions of symbolic links; the
       chmod system call cannot change their permissions.   This  is
       not  a  problem  since  the permissions of symbolic links are
       never used.  However, for each symbolic link  listed  on  the
       command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to
       file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links  encountered
       during recursive directory traversals.

       <p> SETUID AND SETGID BITS <br>
       chmod  clears  the  set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the
       file's group ID does not match the user's effective group  ID
       or one of the user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user
       has  appropriate  privileges.   Additional  restrictions  may
       cause  the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE
       to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and func‐
       tionality  of  the  underlying  chmod  system  call.  When in
       doubt, check the underlying system behavior.

       <p>  For directories chmod preserves set-user-ID and  set-group-ID
       bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or
       clear the bits with symbolic modes  like  u+s  and  g-s.   To
       clear these bits for directories with a numeric mode requires
       an additional leading zero, or leading = like 00755 , or =755

       <p> RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT <br>
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a  single  bit,
       whose  interpretation depends on the file type.  For directo‐
       ries, it prevents unprivileged users from removing or  renam‐
       ing  a  file in the directory unless they own the file or the
       directory; this is called the restricted  deletion  flag  for
       the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable direc‐
       tories like /tmp.  For regular files on some  older  systems,
       the  bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so
       it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky
       bit.

       <p> OPTIONS <br>
       Change  the  mode  of  each  FILE to MODE.  With --reference,
       change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       <p>     -c, --changes <br>
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

              <p>   -f, --silent, --quiet <br>
              suppress most error messages

              <p>   -v, --verbose <br>
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

              <p>    --no-preserve-root <br>
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

              <p>  --preserve-root <br>
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

              <p>     --reference=RFILE <br>
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

              <p>        -R, --recursive <br>
              change files and directories recursively

              <p>     --help display this help and exit <br>

                <p>    --version <br>
              output version information and exit

              <p>    Each        MODE        is        of         the         form
       '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
